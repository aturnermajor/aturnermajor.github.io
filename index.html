	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I completed my year abroad in Berlin from August 2015 until June 2016. As I study History and German I only needed to spend time focusing on one language. <br><br>
	When I arrived in Berlin there were loads of things I had to sort out and think about which I hadn't known before going. I thought about how much easier it would have been if all the information had been grouped together for me before I went, so this is what this site is trying to do. I hope you find it helpful!</p>
