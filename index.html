		<p id="about-me-top"><span><strong>About Me</strong></span><br>
		I completed my year abroad in Berlin from August 2015 until June 2016. As I study History and German I only needed to spend time focusing on one language. <br>
		</p>
		<p>
		When I arrived in Berlin there were loads of things I had to sort out and think about which I hadn't known before going. I thought about how much easier it would have been if all the information had been grouped together for me before I went, so this is what this site is trying to do. I hope you find it helpful!

		<p><span><strong>Where in Berlin?</strong></span><br>
		One of the first things to do is to decide where in Berlin you want to live. This will partly be based on where you're working or studying, but here is a quick overview of the characters of the different areas of the city.</p></div>

	<div class="main" id="anmeldung">
		<p><span><strong>Anmeldung</strong></span><br>
		One thing that Germans have to do that we don't is their Anmeldung. If you are moving to a German city for more than three months you are supposed to do this. It is a nuisance though, so do you have to? Here are some reasons why you should:
		</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You can only set up a bank account with an Anmeldung certificate</li>
				<li>Many other processes in German life (e.g. joining a football team) require one</li>
				<li>It is illegal not to </li>
			</ol>
		<p>
		So how do you actually do your Anmeldung? The hard bit is getting an appointment. Because so many people are trying to move to Berlin all the time, appointments are booked up literally months in advance. You can use this <a href="https://service.berlin.de/terminvereinbarung/termin/tag.php?termin=1&anliegen[]=120686&dienstleisterlist=122210,122217,122219,122227,122231,122243,122252,122260,122262,122254,122271,122273,122277,122280,122282,122284,122291,122285,122286,122296,150230,122301,122297,122294,122312,122314,122304,122311,122309,317869,324433,325341,324434,122281,324414,122283,122279,122276,122274,122267,122246,122251,122257,122208,122226&herkunft=http%3A%2F%2Fservice.berlin.de%2Fdienstleistung%2F120686%2F">link</a> to search and book appointments. If you are planning to move to Berlin in a few months time, now is when you should be booking one.<br><br>
		<strong>But I move out in a week and have no appointment!</strong> This isn't a huge problem. People with appointments often have to cancel them and then they become available again online. This just means you will have to spend a lot of time searching through the page.

	<div class="main" id="accommodation">
		<p><span><strong>Accommodation</strong></span><br>
		The vast majority of people in Berlin just rent their apartments. This is a big advantage for visitors because there is quite a high turnover and people often let out their rooms when they spend a semester abroad. The big challenge in Berlin is that the rental market is incredibly competitive. Something could be advertised in at 9am and already let by 9.30.<br>
		I suggested using a site called <a href="http://www.wg-gesucht.de/">WG-Gesucht</a> where you can browse apartments and send letters information about yourself. The important thing here to send out <strong>A LOT</strong> of emails. I sent out about 50, received 15 replies and viewed about 8 properties. I then got accepted by 3. I had a fairly easy time of it. I knew some people who searched for months before finding somewhere to stay. <br><br>
		<strong>BEWARE</strong><br>
		WG-Gesucht does experience a lot of scams. Some people offer you a place to stay but demand a deposit before letting you see the apartment. This does happen to people - one person I knew lost €1200 this way.

		Most of all - enjoy the city! It's awesome and once you've got the admin out of the way make the most of it.
